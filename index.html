        <p>	&emsp;Hi, I'm Jordan, a second-year student at Dong Hwa University, major in CSIE.<br><br>
            &emsp;During this past one and half years, I accomplish some maze generate algorithms and pathfinding algorithms. For instance, A*, Dijkstra, Prim's, Kruskal's, and of course Recursive. Also, I try to write some web pages that can connect to the back-end database with MySQL. Furthermore, due to the AI field becomes more popular than before, I use the red-wine dataset for data mining with others. And try to hand in the AI field.<br><br>
            &emsp;But to be honest, I don't acquire programming before college as most Taiwanese CSIE students do. I am just deeply attracted by this field during this past one and half years.</p>
